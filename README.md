# What to read, listen to and watch in Data Science

This is a small collection of very curated resources centered in Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligente. These resources vary but in general they are not a collection of state of the art academic papers. They are more a collection of posts, talks and lectures that have defined and shaped what Data Science and Applied Machine Learning are today. What's important, what's not, how to work, how not to work, etc. Some of these resources have been copied shamelessly all over the internet but here you can find the original sources. It's more of a personal collection for me to understand the industry that I work in and not to lose sight to what's important and what's just hype. Honest, rigorous, thoughtful and relevant reflections about what Data Science is and should be.

Some of them I read or follow daily or weekly and some I just have a look at every once in a while to see what's up. I hope you find them as interesting as I do.

## Books:

The only two technical textbooks that I have read from the first to the last page are the Statistical Learning pair:

- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani.
- [Elements of Statisitcal Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani and Jerome Friedman.

By far the most useful. Very well structured, entertaining and located in the sweetspot of introductory and reference textbook. I think I have read at least 3 times the chapter on Model Selection of the first book. If you have time and interest to read two books regarding ML, just read these two. Period.

Lately I have been trying to learn the basics of Deep Learning in a more rigorous way. I did the [Deep Learning coursera specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) which I completely recommend but for quick doubts or to refresh stuff I usually consult the following two ebooks:

- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael Nielsen.
- [Dive into Deep Learning](http://d2l.ai/index.html) by Aston Zhang, Zack C. Lipton, Mu Li and Alex J. Smola.

The Nielsen one is my go-to resource when I need to solve some quick doubt regarding DL. It's rigorous, practical, thoughful and damn useful.

Finally, my favourite technical book I have ever read: Statistical Rethinking by Professor Richard McElreath. I feel sometimes that statistical rigour is a casualty in the hype war of Machine Learning and it's such a shame. I believe most of the problems we face as data scientists are solvable with coherent data, simple models and rigorous statistical analysis. Professor McElreath focuses on Bayesian statistics but it starts from very basic concepts such as uncertainty, probability and such and works from there. Even if in your day to day work to mainly use frequency-based statistics (which is totally fine by the way) being able to think in a more bayesian way is very useful and very healthy.
